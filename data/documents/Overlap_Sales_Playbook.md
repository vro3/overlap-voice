## PART 1: METHODOLOGY TO FIND THEM

### The Three Channels

You don't need 100 leads. You need 10 good ones. Here's where they come from, in order of conversion likelihood.

---

#### CHANNEL 1: WARM NETWORK (Do This Week)

**Method:** Direct outreach to people you already know or are 1 degree from.

**Process:**
1. Open your phone contacts, scroll through, and ask: "Does this person run a business where most of the knowledge lives in their head?"
2. Open LinkedIn, go to your connections, filter by "Nashville" + "Owner/Founder/CEO"
3. Ask Tim Grable: "Who in your network is a smart business owner who's tried AI and been frustrated?"
4. Ask your Nashville entertainment partners (Natasha, 12 South, Goodness Gracious): same question
5. Ask Tobi: "Know any other creators with product catalogs and support email problems?"

**Target:** 15-20 names in 48 hours. Not companies. People.

**Why this works:** You're not selling to strangers. You're offering something valuable to people who already trust you. The conversion rate on warm outreach is 30-50% for a low-friction ask.

---

#### CHANNEL 2: LOCAL COMMUNITY (Weeks 1-3)

**Method:** Nashville business communities, meetups, co-working spaces, chambers of commerce.

**Places to mine:**
- Nashville Entrepreneur Center (EC) — events, members, alumni
- Nashville Chamber of Commerce — small business directory
- Nashville Technology Council — if they have a small business track
- Local co-working spaces (WeWork Nashville, Industrious, Center 615) — bulletin boards, Slack channels, community managers
- Nashville SCORE chapter — free mentoring org, they know every small business owner in town
- Industry-specific meetups (real estate associations, contractor guilds, photographer groups)

**Process:**
1. Attend 2-3 events in the next two weeks
2. Don't pitch. Listen for people complaining about marketing, AI tools, or "not having time"
3. When someone describes the problem The Overlap solves (without knowing it), say: "I've been working on something that might help. Can I buy you coffee and show you?"

**Target:** 5-10 conversations from community exposure.

---

#### CHANNEL 3: LINKEDIN CONTENT + INBOUND (Weeks 2-8)

**Method:** Post about The Overlap methodology. Let people come to you.

**Content cadence:** 3 posts per week.

**Post types that work:**
- "Here's what happened when I extracted 28 years of business knowledge into a document" (origin story)
- "I built an AI system for a German music creator. 12 hours. $0/month infrastructure. Here's what happened" (case study)
- "Most people think AI fails because the tool is bad. It fails because the input is bad." (insight post)
- "The fear of AI isn't really about losing your job. It's about finding out your job was never as special as you thought." (provocative thought leadership)
- Before/after screenshots of the app (product demo)

**What NOT to post:** Anything that sounds like a course launch or hustle culture. No "I cracked the code." No "DM me for details." You're not that guy.

**Target:** 3-5 inbound inquiries within 30 days of consistent posting.

---

## PART 2: HOW TO APPROACH (SCRIPTS)

### The Core Principle

You're not selling a product. You're offering to solve a problem they already have but haven't named yet. The script should make them feel understood, not pitched.

---

### SCRIPT 1: WARM OUTREACH (Text/DM to someone you know)

```
Hey [Name] — random question for you.

You know how you've got [decades/years] of [their expertise] 
in your head, and every time you try to use ChatGPT or any 
AI tool it gives you generic garbage because it doesn't 
actually know your business?

I've been working on a process that fixes that. It takes 
about 2-3 hours, and by the end, AI tools actually sound 
like you and know what you know.

I'm testing it with 10 people right now and I think you'd 
be a perfect fit. Can I buy you coffee and walk you through 
what it looks like?

No pitch. I genuinely want your feedback on whether this 
is useful.
```

**Why this works:** It describes their exact pain (AI gives generic output), offers a specific solution (2-3 hours), makes a low-friction ask (coffee), and frames it as collaboration not sales (I want your feedback).

---

### SCRIPT 2: WARM INTRODUCTION (When someone refers you)

```
Hey [Name] — [Referrer] suggested I reach out to you.

I've been building a process that helps business owners 
get AI to actually work for their specific business — not 
generic advice, but tools that know your clients, your 
voice, your pricing, your expertise.

[Referrer] thought you'd find it useful because [specific 
reason — "you've got 20 years of design knowledge" or 
"you mentioned struggling with AI tools"].

It takes about 2-3 hours and the output is a document 
that permanently changes how AI works for you. I'm running 
a small pilot right now — would you want to be part of it?

Happy to explain more over a quick call if you're curious.
```

---

### SCRIPT 3: COMMUNITY/EVENT FOLLOW-UP (After meeting someone at an event)

```
Hey [Name] — great meeting you at [event] last [day].

When you mentioned [the thing they complained about — 
"spending all weekend on proposals" or "AI never gets 
your tone right" or "repeating yourself to every new 
client"], it reminded me of exactly why I built this thing.

I have a process called The Overlap — basically a 2-3 hour 
guided conversation that extracts everything AI needs to 
know about your business so it stops giving you generic 
garbage and starts sounding like you.

I just did this for a music tech creator in Germany. He 
went from 3 hours/day on customer support to 30 minutes. 
AI drafts every email in his exact voice now.

Would you want to try it? I'm running a pilot with 10 
businesses and I think yours would be a great fit.
```

---

### SCRIPT 4: LINKEDIN DM (Cold but strategic — to someone whose content you've engaged with)

```
[Name] — I've been following your posts about [topic] 
and your perspective on [specific thing they said] really 
resonated.

Quick question: do you ever feel like AI tools should be 
more useful for your business but they just... aren't? Like 
they give you generic output that doesn't sound like you 
or know what you actually do?

I built a process that solves that. It's called The Overlap 
— a guided extraction that documents your expertise, voice, 
and positioning so AI tools actually work for YOUR business 
specifically.

Not selling anything — I'm in pilot mode and looking for 
smart business owners to test it with. If you're curious, 
I'd love to tell you more.
```

---

### SCRIPT 5: THE "I NEED GUINEA PIGS" EMAIL (Batch outreach to 10-15 warm contacts)

```
Subject: I need 10 guinea pigs (seriously)

Hey [Name],

I've spent the last 5 months building something and I need 
real business owners to test it before I take it to market.

Here's the short version: I figured out why AI tools fail 
for most small businesses. It's not the tools — it's that 
nobody helped the business owner articulate what makes them 
valuable first. So the AI has nothing real to work with.

I built a guided process called The Overlap that fixes this. 
It takes 2-3 hours. You talk, I guide, and by the end you 
have a structured document that makes every AI tool you 
touch dramatically better at understanding your business.

I already tested it on myself (28 years of entertainment 
business, fully documented) and on a music tech creator in 
Germany (cut his daily support time from 3 hours to 30 
minutes).

Now I need 10 more people across different industries to 
prove it works everywhere.

You'd be doing me a favor. And you'd walk away with 
something genuinely useful.

Interested?

-Vince
```

**Why "guinea pigs" works:** It's disarming. It's honest. It removes the sales pressure entirely. People WANT to be helpful, especially when they trust you. And "guinea pig" implies they're getting something for free or cheap — which they are in the pilot phase.

---

## PART 3: HOW TO CLOSE

### The Pilot Close (First 10 Clients)

For your first 10 extractions, don't close like a salesman. Close like a researcher.

**The Conversation Flow:**

1. **After they express interest:** "Great — here's how it works. We schedule a 2-3 hour session. I walk you through a guided conversation — it's voice-based, so you just talk. I ask the questions that pull out what AI needs to know about your business. By the end, you have a structured document that changes how AI works for you permanently."

2. **The price frame:** "I'm doing the first 10 at a pilot rate — $1,500 for the full extraction. Once I have the case studies to prove it works across industries, the price goes to $3,000-$5,000. You're getting the methodology at cost because I need the data."

3. **If they hesitate on price:** "Think about it this way — how many hours a week do you spend doing things AI could handle if it actually knew your business? If the answer is more than 5 hours, this pays for itself in a month."

4. **If they ask "what do I get?":** "You get a structured document — we call it a Gospel — that contains your expertise, your voice, your positioning, your decision-making frameworks, and your service structure. You can feed it to any AI tool — ChatGPT, Claude, whatever — and it will operate as if it's worked with you for years. Plus, you get clarity about your own business that most people never achieve."

5. **The close:** "Can we get something on the calendar in the next two weeks?"

---

### The Standard Close (Post-Pilot)

Once you have case studies:

1. **Discovery call (15 min):** Listen. Ask: "What does your AI give you right now when you try to use it for your business?" Let them describe the frustration.

2. **The reframe:** "That's because it doesn't know you. It's like hiring an assistant who's never met you, doesn't know your clients, and has never seen how you work. The Overlap is the onboarding process you'd give that assistant — except the assistant is every AI tool you'll ever use."

3. **Social proof:** "I did this with [case study]. [Specific result]. Same process, different industry."

4. **Price anchor:** State the price confidently. No apologizing. "The extraction is [$X]. That includes the full guided session, the Gospel document, and 30 days of follow-up to refine it."

5. **Close:** "Want to get started?"

---

### Objection Handling

**"I can just do this myself with ChatGPT."**
"You can. Most people try. The problem is you don't know what a weak answer sounds like. When I ask 'who's your ideal client?' and you say 'anyone who needs my services,' that's useless to AI. I push back until we get to the real answer. That's what you're paying for — the extraction skill, not the questions."

**"$3,000 is a lot for a conversation."**
"It's not a conversation — it's a permanent asset. Once your Gospel is built, every AI tool you use works better forever. No monthly subscription. No retraining. The document is yours. And if you're spending even 5 hours a week on tasks AI could handle with this knowledge, you break even in 6 weeks."

**"I don't really use AI that much."**
"You will. And when you do, you'll either spend months trying to teach it about your business through trial and error, or you'll have a document ready that makes it useful from day one. This is future-proofing."

**"Can I see an example of what the output looks like?"**
"Absolutely." [Show a redacted Gospel excerpt or the TobiBrain case study results — not the full document, but enough to demonstrate the structure and depth.]

**"What if it doesn't work for my business?"**
[See guarantee section below.]

---

## PART 4: THE GUARANTEE

### The Clarity Guarantee

Don't guarantee business results (revenue, time savings, ROI). You can't control what they do with the output. Guarantee the extraction itself.

**The offer:**

> **"If you complete the full Overlap extraction and don't walk away with a clearer understanding of your own business positioning than you've ever had — I'll refund you in full. No questions."**

**Why this works:**
- It's specific (clarity, not revenue)
- It's measurable by the client's own experience
- It's essentially zero-risk for you because NOBODY goes through a 2-3 hour guided extraction of their entire business and comes out without more clarity. The process itself guarantees the outcome.
- It removes the purchase objection without promising something you can't deliver

**What NOT to guarantee:**
- "Your AI will work perfectly" — you can't control how they use the output
- "You'll save X hours per week" — depends on their implementation
- "Revenue increase" — too many variables
- Time-based satisfaction ("30 days or your money back") — the value is immediate, not delayed

---

### The Pilot Guarantee (First 10 Clients)

For the pilot, be even more generous:

> **"You're one of 10 pilot clients. If you don't find this useful, don't pay. Seriously. I need honest feedback more than I need $1,500."**

This eliminates ALL friction and gets people in the door. You're going to get 10/10 people saying it was useful because it IS useful. But removing the risk makes the "yes" instant.

---

## PART 5: PRICING STRUCTURE

### The Pricing Philosophy

Price on the value of the asset created, not the hours spent. A Gospel document that permanently upgrades someone's AI capability is worth thousands, not hundreds. Don't price like a freelancer. Price like a consultant delivering a strategic asset.

---

---

### Pricing Psychology Notes

**Why not cheaper:**
- Below $1,000, people don't take it seriously. They'll cancel, no-show, or half-ass the answers.
- The extraction requires real vulnerability. People who pay $1,500+ show up ready to be honest.
- Your time is worth $500/hr based on your entertainment rates. 3 hours = $1,500 at minimum.

**Why not more expensive (yet):**
- You don't have enough case studies to justify $5K+ as a standard rate.
- The pilot price builds the case study portfolio that supports the premium price.
- Once you have 10 case studies across 7 industries, $3K-$5K is easy to defend.

**The upsell path:**
- Client pays $1,500 for extraction (Tier 2)
- Realizes the Gospel is incredibly valuable
- Asks "can you build the AI system too?"
- Upsell to Tier 3 ($7,500-$15,000)
- This will happen naturally. Don't force it in the initial pitch.
