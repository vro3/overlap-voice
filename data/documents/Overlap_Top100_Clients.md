# The Overlap — Top 100 Client Candidates for Phase 1 Validation
## Prioritized by means, likelihood of paying, and accessibility to Vince
**Created:** February 12, 2026

---

## SELECTION CRITERIA

Every candidate on this list was filtered through four lenses:

1. **Means** — Can they afford $1,500-$10,000? (Filters out hobbyists and startups burning cash)
2. **Pain** — Do they have tacit knowledge trapped in their head that AI could help with? (Filters out people who don't need this)
3. **Accessibility** — Does Vince have a warm path to reach them? (Nashville network, entertainment industry, personal connections, shared communities)
4. **Case Study Value** — Would their story convince an investor? (Filters for variety, recognizability, and "if it works for THEM..." proof)

---

## ACCESSIBILITY TIERS

- **🟢 TIER 1 — WARM (1-2 degrees):** Vince knows them directly, or has a direct contact who can make an introduction. Can reach out today.
- **🟡 TIER 2 — REACHABLE (2-3 degrees):** In Vince's extended network or industry. Requires a strategic introduction or a compelling cold outreach that leverages shared context.
- **🔴 TIER 3 — ASPIRATIONAL (cold but strategic):** No direct path, but the case study would be so valuable it's worth pursuing. These are stretch targets.

## STRATEGIC INVESTOR GROUPINGS

These aren't random. Each group tells a specific story to investors.

### 🏆 THE KILLER FIRST 10 (Do These First)

| # | Client | Why First |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Tobi Hunke (AbletonDrummer) | ✅ ALREADY DONE. Your proof of concept. |
| 2 | Tim Grable (Grable Group) | Business partner. Immediate access. Entertainment agency = complex tacit knowledge. |
| 3 | 1 Nashville consultant | Professional services proves it's not just for creatives. |
| 4 | 1 Nashville real estate agent | Mainstream business. "If a realtor uses this..." |
| 5 | 1 Nashville wedding photographer | Creative entrepreneur with high client volume. |
| 6 | 1 small marketing agency founder | Proves it works for agencies, not just solos. |
| 7 | 1 specialty contractor | Blue collar meets AI. The "unexpected" case study. |
| 8 | 1 YouTuber/creator (via Tobi connection) | Content creator visibility. Potential organic marketing. |
| 9 | 1 financial advisor | High-income professional. Proves premium positioning. |
| 10 | Sean Kirkland / Cohera | Warm contact. Global DMC. Enterprise-adjacent proof. |

**Why this group wins:** It spans 7 different industries. It includes both creative and traditional businesses. It ranges from solo operators to multi-person companies. Every investor objection ("does it work for X?") is pre-answered.

---

### 📊 INVESTOR STORY GROUPINGS

**"The Creative Proof" (Cases 1-5):**
Tobi + Tim + Natasha + 12 South + photographer
→ Story: "We started where we know best — creative entrepreneurs with deep expertise. Every one of them had the same problem: amazing at what they do, terrible at making AI useful."

**"The Professional Leap" (Cases 3, 6, 9):**
Consultant + agency founder + financial advisor
→ Story: "Then we tested with professionals whose entire value is their expertise. Same result: extraction unlocks AI utility."

**"The Blue Collar Surprise" (Case 7):**
Specialty contractor
→ Story: "Then we tried something unexpected. A contractor. 30 years of building knowledge, all in his head. After extraction, his AI could draft estimates, answer client questions, and manage project specs in his voice. If it works for a contractor, it works for anyone."

**"The Scale Signal" (Cases 8, 10):**
YouTuber + Cohera
→ Story: "A content creator with 200K subscribers and a global DMC with offices across the US. Same methodology, same result. This scales from solo to enterprise."

---

### 🎯 THE "YACHT MONEY" PATH

If the first 10 validate, here's the sequence that attracts serious money:

1. **Cases 1-10** prove it works across industries → Seed round credibility
2. **Land 1 aspirational target** (Gary Vee, Pat Flynn, Chris Do) → That person talks about it to their audience → Organic inbound explodes
3. **License to executive coaches** (Group C, #41-45) → They use The Overlap with THEIR clients → Multiplier effect without Vince in the room
4. **API integration with one AI agent platform** → Infrastructure positioning → Series A territory
5. **"Powered by Overlap"** becomes the knowledge onboarding standard → That's when the yachts show up

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **This week:** Reach out to Tim Grable about being client #2. He'll say yes because he's your partner and he'll see the value immediately.
2. **This week:** Identify 1 specific person in each Nashville category (consultant, realtor, photographer, contractor). Names, not categories.
3. **Next week:** Reach out to 5 warm Nashville contacts with a simple pitch: "I'm testing a new methodology and I need 10 guinea pigs. It takes 2-3 hours of your time and it'll permanently change how AI works for your business. Interested?"
4. **Before Feb 24:** Have at least 2-3 scheduled extractions so you can tell Jason "I have paying clients lined up."
