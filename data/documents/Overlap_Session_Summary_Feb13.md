## SECTION 1: PITCH STATUS (Feb 24, 2026 — LAUNCH Call)

### The Meeting
- **Date:** February 24, 2026, 10:30am Central
- **Format:** 15-minute Zoom — 5 min pitch/demo + Q&A
- **Contact:** openclaw@launch.co
- **Audience:** Jason Calacanis and LAUNCH team
- **Ask:** $25K seed for 90-day validation sprint

### Working Product
- overlap-voice.vercel.app (voice-to-text guided questionnaire built with Claude)
- Format: Mostly talking + screen sharing with created assets

### 7-Slide Deck Structure (Decided)
1. **The Problem** — "AI agents are here. Small businesses aren't ready." Agents only as smart as what they know.
2. **Why It Fails** — "Building better pipes. Nobody solving what goes in pipes."
3. **The Insight** — Origin story: 28 years Fortune 500, "drowning in competence without clarity"
4. **The Overlap** — "Where passion meets profit — and AI actually works." Guided extraction → structured business identity → knowledge layer for any AI agent.
5. **Live Demo** — 60 seconds showing app, 2-3 questions, voice-to-text, markdown output, then Vince's Claude setup as "after" state.
6. **The Business** — Market size, revenue model, scaling strategy
7. **The Ask** — What $25K buys, timeline, closer: "Not a developer pitching a feature. An entertainer who figured out why AI works for some people and fails for everyone else."

### Strategic Decisions
- No VEEC in pitch (distraction)
- AI Amplification video as follow-up/bonus only
- No philosophical frameworks unless Jason asks "why does this work"
- Lead with results, headcount equivalence, and proof

---

## SECTION 2: BUSINESS MODEL

### $25K Funds 90-Day Validation Sprint
- 10 facilitated Overlap extractions across 3-4 industries
- $1,500-$3,000 each (generating revenue during validation)
- Deliverables: 5+ case studies, proven methodology, refined app, clear picture of what scales

### Revenue Model Layers
- **Tier 1 — Self-Guided App:** $149 one-time or $29/month (future, after pilot validates)
- **Tier 2 — Guided Extraction:** $1,500 pilot / $3,000 standard / $5,000 premium (CORE OFFERING NOW)
- **Tier 3 — Full Knowledge Architecture:** $7,500-$15,000 (TobiBrain-style system build)
- **Tier 4 — Enterprise/Licensing:** $10,000 certification + $500/month license (future)

### ROI Metric
Time savings: "AI tools went from 30 minutes hand-holding per task to usable output first try."

## SECTION 3: CASE STUDY — TOBIBRAIN

- **Client:** Tobi Hunke (AbletonDrummer) — 149 Max for Live products, 524 YouTube videos, bilingual (EN/DE)
- **Problem:** 2-3 hours daily on repetitive customer support
- **Solution:** 7 sessions (~12 hours) → TobiBrain AI knowledge base + email drafting system
- **Knowledge Base:** 20,165 lines (1.6 MB) — 524 video transcripts, 166 blog posts, 149 products, 543 real email Q&A pairs, all markdown files, $0 infrastructure cost
- **Results:** Daily support time 3 hours → 30 minutes. AI drafts every email in Tobi's exact voice, both languages, correct product links/video timestamps. Draft-only (human reviews). CORRECTIONS.md override system.
- **30-second pitch version:** "12 hours of extraction work. Zero infrastructure cost. He went from 3 hours a day on customer support to 30 minutes. AI drafts every email in his exact voice — English AND German — because we built the knowledge layer first."

## SECTION 4: INTELLECTUAL FRAMEWORK

### Core Concepts (with attributions)
- **Polanyi's Paradox** — "We can know more than we can tell" (Michael Polanyi / David Autor)
- **Centaur Model** — "Weak human + machine + better process > strong computer alone" (Kasparov)
- **Turing Trap** — Augment don't imitate (Brynjolfsson)
- **Jagged Technological Frontier** — AI good at surprising things, bad at surprising things (Ethan Mollick)
- **Directed Emergence** — Human sets constraints, AI generates within them (Brian Eno)
- **Authenticity Premium** — "When everything can be faked, authenticity becomes the ultimate luxury" (Ted Gioia)
- **Knowledge Architecture** — Human role shifts from doing work to structuring knowledge that guides AI reasoning

### Key Insight
Vince's entire career has been directed emergence: show design = building structure (LED programming, cue sequences, emotional arc), then performing within constraints live. Same skill applied to AI knowledge architecture. Not a pivot — pattern recognition.

## SECTION 6: OPENCLAW ECOSYSTEM INTELLIGENCE

### What OpenClaw Is
- Open-source AI agent platform, self-hosted, runs 24/7
- 140K+ GitHub stars, fastest-growing repo in GitHub history
- Connects to Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, etc.
- Has persistent memory, file access, browser control, email, calendar, shell
- Agents defined by SOUL.md (identity), MEMORY.md (knowledge), AGENTS.md (rules), skill files (workflows)
- Multi-agent orchestration with subagents, cron jobs, heartbeats

### Jason Calacanis + OpenClaw (Critical for Pitch)

**His usage at LAUNCH:**
- Multiple OpenClaw agents with their own Slack/Notion/Docs accounts — treated as employees
- 20-30% of existing work already agent-handled, +10-20% migration per month
- Goal: replace 20 employees with "OpenClaw Ultron"
- Producer Oliver Korzen estimates 60% of production work automatable in 30 days
- Self-optimizing cron job reviews agent performance every morning

**His investment thesis:**
- Writing $25K-$125K checks for OpenClaw-based startups
- "Hundreds of applications in 8 hours" for the $25K offer
- Funded Agent37 ($125K — hosted OpenClaw for non-technical users) and Intent Company ($125K — Meta glasses + OpenClaw) ON AIR
- Next Founder University cohort will ALL build with OpenClaw
- Screens for: team, vision, working project/proof of work

**His language/framing:**
- "Most viral AI project in history"
- "Age of Ultron" / "digital Replicants"
- Talks in FTE-equivalents and % of work replaced
- "Your headcount is now a software license"
- Agents as employees, not tools
- Philosophically rejects in-app AI (Notion AI, Slack AI) in favor of external agent orchestration
- Started with security concerns (Feb 3) but invested heavily anyway (Feb 10-12)
- Best practice tweet: "Kimi + OpenClaw Mac Studio encrypted and wiping all searches in real time with a seppuku kill switch"

**His "playbook" for laid-off workers:**
1. Document all inputs, processes, and outputs of your prior role (THIS IS THE OVERLAP)
2. Implement as OpenClaw system
3. Go to manager's manager, show them "your headcount is now a software license"
4. Demand 20% raise — "You will be hired back immediately"
5. If they say no, treat it as startup IP, pitch 10 startups

**What he rewards in founders:**
- Initiative (built something, got users)
- Real traction, even if small
- Clear, productized OpenClaw use cases
- Agent-driven workflows that touch real systems and produce measurable leverage
- Ship first, then raise

### The Overlap's Position in the OpenClaw Ecosystem

**The core gap everyone describes but nobody fills:**
- OpenClaw setup guides all say "brain dump everything" in the initial session
- Every technical guide emphasizes skill files and SOUL.md as "the most important thing"
- Nobody offers a methodology for creating those files well
- Users spend weeks of trial and error discovering what should be in their knowledge layer
- The Overlap produces the knowledge layer in one afternoon

**Specific mapping:**
| OpenClaw Concept | The Overlap Equivalent |
|---|---|
| SOUL.md (identity, voice, boundaries) | Gospel — identity/positioning sections |
| MEMORY.md (long-term knowledge) | Gospel — expertise/knowledge base |
| STRATEGY.md (domain playbooks) | Gospel — decision frameworks, service structure |
| Skill files (workflow instructions) | Gospel — operational rules, processes |
| HEARTBEAT.md (periodic tasks) | Gospel — monitoring/review patterns |
| CORRECTIONS.md (learned lessons) | TobiBrain CORRECTIONS.md pattern (already built) |

**Key quotes from ecosystem that validate The Overlap:**
- "The agent is only as good as its memory" (Oliver Henry / Larry TikTok case study)
- "With this model I can literally spin up a new employee in 5 minutes, and they will fully understand their job like they worked with me for 100 years" (Mac Mini fleet operator)
- "You wouldn't bring in a recent college grad and dump a thousand page corporate manual on their desk" (LAUNCH's own Ultron article)
- "Skills compound — each new skill makes OpenClaw exponentially more powerful" (OpenClaw docs)
- "Every failure became a rule. Every success became a formula." (Oliver Henry)
- "The skill files are genuinely the most important thing in the whole system" (Larry the agent)
- "Keep HEARTBEAT.md small to minimize token overhead" (OpenClaw docs — validates lean Gospel approach)

### OpenClaw Security Angle
- Models trained to be helpful, not protective — helpfulness is a vulnerability
- 341 malicious skills found on ClawHub
- Prompt injection via email is a major vector
- Plain text API keys, VPS exposure
- **The Overlap connection:** A Gospel document defines identity-level boundaries, not just task rules. An agent that deeply knows who it works for is harder to redirect than one with a blank slate and a list of rules.

### OpenAI/Sherwin Wu Data Points (from Vince's dump)
- 95% of OpenAI engineers use Codex, those who embrace AI tools open 70% more PRs
- Top performers become disproportionately more productive with AI tools — gap widening
- Most enterprise AI deployments have negative ROI (top-down mandates without bottom-up adoption)
- The one-person billion-dollar startup is coming, with explosion of $10M-$100M companies
- Business process automation is the underrated AI opportunity
- Audio is the next frontier for multimodal AI (Overlap app is already voice-based)

## SECTION 7: PITCH REFRAME FOR JASON'S LANGUAGE

### Before (Vince's natural frame):
"The Overlap extracts tacit knowledge into structured documentation that makes AI genuinely useful."

### After (Jason's language):
"You're telling people to learn OpenClaw and automate their jobs. Step 1 of your playbook is 'document all inputs, processes, and outputs.' That documentation step is the hardest part — and nobody's solving it. People brain dump for 5 minutes, give the agent garbage, and then blame the tool. The Overlap IS Step 1 of your playbook, productized. One afternoon, structured extraction, and the agent actually works."

### The killer positioning:
- Agent37 removes the TECHNICAL friction of setting up OpenClaw ($125K investment)
- The Overlap removes the KNOWLEDGE friction of making OpenClaw useful
- Same ecosystem gap, different layer
- "Agent37 is Shopify for hosting. The Overlap is Shopify for knowledge."

### Numbers to hit in pitch:
- "TobiBrain: 12 hours extraction → 3 hours/day support dropped to 30 minutes → $0/month infrastructure"
- "One afternoon produces the SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, and skill files that take weeks of trial and error"
- "$25K funds 10 paid extractions across 4+ industries, generating $15K-$45K in revenue during validation"
- Frame everything in FTE-equivalents and % of work automated

## SECTION 9: DATA DUMP ITEMS TO REVISIT

These were logged during the OpenClaw data dump session and need deeper analysis when continuing:

1. **Oliver Henry / Larry TikTok case study** — Full playbook for OpenClaw agent generating TikTok content. Skill files = Gospel docs. Shows the trial-and-error process The Overlap eliminates.

2. **Legal privilege ruling** — Federal judge ruled AI-prepared documents not protected by attorney-client privilege. Future enterprise opportunity: private/local AI + structured knowledge inside attorney-client relationship.

3. **cc-wf-studio GitHub repo** — Vince shared a link but couldn't access. Need to revisit what this is.

4. **Jason's X video transcripts** — Vince wants transcripts from Jason's X video posts. Solution: yt-dlp (supports X URLs) + Whisper for transcription. Build the workflow in next session.

5. **OpenClaw as personal tool for Vince** — Analysis written about how Vince could deploy OpenClaw for his own business (email monitoring, SEO tracking, performer logistics, social content). Recommendation: hold off until after LAUNCH call to stay positioned as infrastructure, not application.

6. **MiniMax M2.5 release** — Open source model matching Opus-level performance. Model layer commoditizing = knowledge layer becomes the only moat. Strengthens Overlap thesis.

7. **Fear of AI = mediocrity exposure** — Deep analysis done. Core insight: "The fear isn't really about AI. It's about loss of control. The Overlap gives people more control — by defining who they are before AI enters the picture." The methodology is therapeutic as much as strategic.

8. **Career as directed emergence** — Vince's entire career is knowledge architecture under a different name. Show design = constraint-setting for reliable emergence. Same skill, different medium. This is the founder story.
