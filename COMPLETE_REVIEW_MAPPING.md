## BRUTAL TRUTH

**Out of 24 questions you reviewed:**
- **22 questions DON'T EXIST** in the deployed 66 (92%)
- **2 questions DO EXIST** in the deployed 66 (8%)
  - Q42 (`voice_industry_jargon`) → `voice_anti_jargon` in deployed
  - Q48 (`market_competitors`) → `mkt_competitors` in deployed

**This means 92% of your review work yesterday was for questions that aren't in the deployed app.**

## What This Means

The deployed 66 and the theoverlap-main 106 were TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT QUESTION SETS.

Your review feedback applies to questions that don't exist in production. To actually improve the deployed app, we need to:

1. Review the ACTUAL deployed 66 questions
2. Apply similar polishing principles
3. Decide if any of the 22 missing questions should be ADDED to the deployed version

---

## Next Steps

**Option 1:** Review the deployed 66 from scratch with same principles
**Option 2:** Port your specific feedback (scope creep definition, unspoken benefits, etc.) to similar questions in the deployed 66
**Option 3:** Add the missing questions you liked to the deployed version

Which do you want to do?
